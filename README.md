Java Web Service Training Program

Java Web Service Training Program
 Course Objective
 Apply the JAX-WS API in the creation of SOAP Web Services and clients
 Apply the JAX-RS API in the creation of RESTful Web Services
 Secure Web Services using WS-Security, Jersey, and OAuth
 Handle errors and exceptions in Web Services and clients
 Create XML documents using namespace declarations and XML schema
 Produce and consume XML and JSON content using JAXB
 Create RESTful Web Service clients using the Jersey Client API
 Understand the role of Web Services

 Learning
 Create XML documents and XML schemas while using XML Namespaces.
 Produce and consume JSON and XML using JAXB.
 Understand WSDL files and the role they play in SOAP based web services and select either a top-down (WSDL first) or bottom-up (code first) approach to the development of SOAP web services.
 Make calls to and implement web services based on SOAP standards using JAX-WS (Metro Stack).
 Implement REST practices in the creation of web services with the JAX-RS specification (Jersey Stack).
 Secure web services using Java EE Security standards, WS-Security extensions, and OAuth 1.0a.

 Benefits to You
 Java EE 6 technology facilitates cross-platform application development through the use of platform neutral network communication, supports HTML5 AJAX enabled applications and mobile clients by creating RESTful web services which use the JSON data-interchange format.
 Audience

 J2EE Developer
 Java Developer
 Java EE Developer
