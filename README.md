Java Web Service Training Program

Java Web Service Training Program
1. **Course Objective**
  1. Apply the JAX-WS API in the creation of SOAP Web Services and clients
  2. Apply the JAX-RS API in the creation of RESTful Web Services
  3. Secure Web Services using WS-Security, Jersey, and OAuth
  4. Handle errors and exceptions in Web Services and clients
  5. Create XML documents using namespace declarations and XML schema
  6. Produce and consume XML and JSON content using JAXB
  7. Create RESTful Web Service clients using the Jersey Client API
  8. Understand the role of Web Services
2. Learning
  1. Create XML documents and XML schemas while using XML Namespaces.
  2. Produce and consume JSON and XML using JAXB.
  3. Understand WSDL files and the role they play in SOAP based web services and select either a top-down (WSDL first) or bottom-up (code first) approach to the development of SOAP web services.
  4. Make calls to and implement web services based on SOAP standards using JAX-WS (Metro Stack).
  5. Implement REST practices in the creation of web services with the JAX-RS specification (Jersey Stack).
  6. Secure web services using Java EE Security standards, WS-Security extensions, and OAuth 1.0a.
3. Benefits to You
  1. Java EE 6 technology facilitates cross-platform application development through the use of platform neutral network communication, supports HTML5 AJAX enabled applications and mobile clients by creating RESTful web services which use the JSON data-interchange format.
4. Audience
