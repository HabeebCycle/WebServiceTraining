REST Vs SOAP 

->Many Media/Dat Types permitted in REST 
-> SOAP Only Allows XML 
-> REST Access allowed with named resources/ or with the help of URI 
-> REST has a better performance and sclability 

-> JSON is better fit for data and parses much faster tham XML. 
-> REST allows better support for browser client due to its support for JSON .
-> SOAP is More secured due to the wide range of encrytion standard avaiable .
-> REST Reads can be cached but SOAP based reads can not be cached.


O2 Notation ...

07:36: in a scenario where I return number of employee records of a department as an arraylist of Employee objects.. I feel SOAP makes more sense than REST, is that right?
