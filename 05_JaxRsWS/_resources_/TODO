Day-9 Weekend Session

Q. A client of SOAP Web Service access/ Consume the Services with the help of WSDL file, How it is consumed when
its REST Web Services....?

A.  With the help of URI:
    URI - Uniform resource Identifies.
    Everything thing in REST is resource.
    Response can be JSON, XML, Plain Text
    Next session we will start with JSON Object returned to Consumer.
    Returned Object/Response can be JSON, XML, Plain Text
    We will have consumer examples.

Q. Where is Difference between URL and URI?

    URI-> Resource Identifier.


    URL-> Uniform Resource Locator
    URL - subset of URI
    Locator and Identifier.

I need clarification on SOAP 1.1 and SOAP 1.2 in the respect of:
1. How it differs from each other?



2. Is there any code level changes we need to do to support both version?
3. Is there any preferred version among two?
    Yes 1.2
4. Do these versions bother the web services development?
    Yes it is, Soap 1.2 required for better integrations with frameworks Web standards, Web2.0

Version - Every software/Concept/Framework launches it' upgraded version.
Backward/Forward Compatibility.
Backward - App developed in Java 1.7 and now run time is Java 1.5(Explicit)
Forward - App developed in Java 1.5 and now run time is Java 1.7(Implicit/Explicit)
        Suppress Warning...

SOAP is a XML FIle...
XML Protocol Working Group
w3c - World Wide Web Consortium.. Provide you certification on Web Technologies.

SOAP 1.1 - 2000, Designed a Protocol
SOAP 1.2 - 2003, extended. Enhancement in SOAP 1.1 / Added Features /

Backward Compatibility:
Forward Compatibility: Implicit What ever SOAP 1.1 do.. SOAP 1.2 can do same...

Technology is evolving, changing rapidly, changing every day, and it' the integration forces to upgrade every one
Changing every day Because client need changes/requirement changes.


SOAP 1.2 brings the Interoperability...

** Ans: Both SOAP 1.1 and 1.2 is w3c standards.
-> SOAP 1.2 Specification / Standard introduces several changes on SOAP 1.1
-> SOAP 1.1 is based on XML, SOAP 1.2 is based on XML Information Set (XML Infoset)
-> XML Infoset is a way to describe a XML using XSD / XML Schema

(XML, XSD, XML Schema will be covered post).


REST could be on demand, is better now...
