Java Web Service 

JAX WS SOAP 
JAX RS REST 


What is difference between SOAP and REST ?

When to Select a SOAP and a REST ?



REST :- Representational State Transfer. is  Architecural style 


w3c World Wide Web Consortium..
 
Components:- Modules which take cares of the transformation of tha data
Connectors:- Mechanism take care of Communication, Coordination among the Components.
Data      :- Element of Information used in Components and Connectionots.

RESTEasy from JBoss
Apache CXF ..
Jersy 








RESTFull web services are built to work on Web . REST is an architecral style specifies constraints sunch as the 
Uniform Interface .

Data and Funcnality are considered as the Resources.
Resources are accessed using the URI's Uniform Resource Identifiers.

Its is Designed to use a StateLess communication Protocol .Its HTTP.

REST is an Architecural style Clients and Servers Exchange representations of resources by using some
Standards Interface and Protocol.


REST ful applications are simple and lightweight ...and faster..

URI's
Uniform Interface :- Resources are maintained /operated using a fixed set of four operations..CRUD..Create, Update , Retrieve , Delete..
                      GET, POST , PUT , DELETE 

Annotaions used in REST.

Message Format supported in REST ...XML, JSON, HTML , Plain Text , JPEG...

Every interatiomc with a resource is Stateless ..


What If we want to do a StateFul transactions. We need to use the Session Management.. URI Rewrtining..Cookies..Hidden form fields..


Performance 
Sclability 
Modifiability


@GET	:- Defines the reading access of the resources...Resource is never changed..Its is IDEMPOTENT. 
@PUT	:- It Creates a new resource.
@DELETE	:- It Removes the resources
@POST	:- Update the exisiting resource or Create a new Resources.



IDEMPOTENT :- Operations on the Resources...It can be repeated any number of times and the result will remain same.


1+0= 1+0+0+0=1  (Operation is Addition and 0 is idempotent)
10*1=10*1*1*1*1*1= (Operation is Multiplcation and 1 is idempotent)





Interface  And Separate the Layers ....


Maintanance 
Support 
Enhance A Application 
Develop from mid ...




Question :- 1) What is Importnace of having Interfaces on top of classes ?  

		Hide more Expose Less...

            Why We have multiple layers in the application development ?
		
		-> Separation Of Concern ...

		-> Clean and Separate Life Style Or You want a messeup ...completx life style

   	    What is StateLess Protocol ?

 	    What is difference between HTTP an Session...

            What is Difference Between URI and URL ..

	    What is query String ?  Append data in the URL/URI

	    What is URL/URI re-writing ..Query String is used to add data in URL re-writing ..
