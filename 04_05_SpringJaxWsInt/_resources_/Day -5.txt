==================

2nd Week.

1) Spring JAX WS Integration Examples and Annotation Used in this Examples
2) SOAP Message Architecure
3) XML Definition and Declaration.


REST Full Web Services.

How JAX RS is different from JAX WS ..Which Implementation to be used in what scenario.


2nd week and 3rd Week we will discuss REST ...


4th Week We will Come back to JAX WS ....SAAJ.. WS Security .....



Spring And JAX WS Integration
=================================


@BindingType

@RequestWrapper  -Supplies the JAXB Genertaed request wrapper bean, and its element name and the 
			namespace for seralization


@ResponseWrapper  - Supplies the JAXB Generated response wrapper been and the Elements name namespace for serilization


---------------: SOAP :------------

-> SOAP is a Simple XML based protocol,,,,to let applications exchange informations over HTTP




SOAP Architecure.
=====================



Web Service :- Network Accessible Interface to application functionality.



SOAP :- Simple Object Access Protocol Its XML Based protocol to let applications exchange informtions over HTTP

        -> It provides the way to communicate between application running on different Operating Systems, 
		with different technology and Programing Langugage



SOAP Is verstile
     Is Platform Indepdent 
     Is Langugae Indepdent 
     Is Simple and Extensible.




SOAP Message Architecure 


-> An Envelop   -> the envelop element is identifier for the XML document as SOAP message.
-> A Header     -> Contains the Header infromtions
-> A Body       -> Call and response infromation
-> A Fault      -> Containing the errors abd Status infromation
-> An Attachment-> filr attachment part of the SOAP.




SOAP Faults messaged are the mechanism by which SOAP Applications report errors.
It is a Interface to the Java Exceptions for a Java WS..





---------------: WSDL :------------


-> WSDL provides a model and a XML fromat to describe the web service.





<!--------------WSDL Elements :---------------- >



Types:- A Container for data Type defintions using XSD .

Message:- An Abstract description and defintion of the data format/types is being communicated.

Operation:- Descriptions of an actions Supported by the services.

Port Type:- Set of Operations supported by one or more Endpoints

Binding :- A Deinite Protocol and data format specification for a Particular Port type.

Port : Its Single end point defines as a Combination of Binding and a Netwrok Address

Service :- A Collection of related End Points
